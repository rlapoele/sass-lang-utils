> A small library of commonly used sass functions written in SCSS.

### Motivation
After writing several libraries, frameworks and style generators in scss for different projects I worked on, I realised that I often ended-up re-searching and re-writing many sass/scss language related utility functions.

I therefore decided to bundle these into a small library and make it available to everyone.

Documentation has been generated using the excellent [sassdoc](http://sassdoc.com/) tool and is available in HTML format in the `/docs` folder.
